# GoogleSearch

this program is somthing i made that takes an excel document and searches the terms in that document
it then spits out an excel document that gives you the results per search and how long it took the find those results
it also captures the screen and saves it as a png and labels it appropriately 

it will do this for Firefox, Chrome, and Internet Explorer

the navigation needs to be reworked a touch given i used the entire path for it's navigation. but that should be an easy fix
